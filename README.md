The AR Orchid business card is an augmented reality business card where information is only accessible by getting in close to an alien plant and reaching for objects tied to associated links. It was developed primarily for AR with the A-frame framework for three.js. The goal was to convey exactly what I'm about in the quickest way possible, by creating an interaction with the type of imaginary creature I find fascinating. Without downloading anything, rapidly, a fantastical horror beast can be transmitted directly to your device. Interaction with the alien other is powerful, can break through preconcieved notions, expand our consciousness past its previously known limits. The orchid is a representation of this connection with the other- with text floating around it that does not quite describe it, but gives more information. I feel a kinship with the alien other. I feel a kinship with the strange. The orchid, in its otherness, was born from this. What does a Linkedin, a Github, a Youtube archive of my work display about me? Does it convey my essential essence, or does it distill that essence into a form that gains some level of understandibility, but loses shape, loses a level of truth. I posit that this is the trade we make when we communicate in any form.

The development of the AR Orchid business card started with this idea- with creating an instantaneous interaction with an other that defies true description. It was first built on Glitch, from a remixed project with an outdated framework for AR in A-frame- for Glitch has the capabiltiy to show real-time updates to the code. The model for the orchid was built, rigged, and animated in Blender, as well as textured with a combination of a hand-drawn texture and a photograph of raw meat. The initial plan was to have different objects clutched tightly in its tentacles which the user would click on to open their associated links. For Linkedin, a polaroid camera. For Github, an old Tandy computer. For Youtube, a VHS tape with "Youtube" on the label. Unfortunately, the "clutching" has not been implemented at this time. To have the functionality of clickable items, those items have to be separate from the orchid. For the items to be separate, but still clutched by the orchid, they would need to be parented to a specific bone on the tentacle. Given that A-frame is largely a scripting-based framework, I have not had the time and energy to learn how to implement this exactly. I am abandoning completely the idea of having the items clutched in the orchid's tentacles, because thinking about it now, trying to access information from a moving object would be more annoying than anything else since this is not intended to be a video game. However, the items are hovering in easily accessible places, with the addition of an eyeball that links to this project's page. I have also added background music.

To access the business card, go to https://bansheegalileo.github.io/orchid-businesscard/ on a mobile device and tap the button that says "AR". From there, focus the central reticle on the letters of the three-dimensional text objects, and press and hold your finger to the screen.
